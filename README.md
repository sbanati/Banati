# Digital Garden

This is my first ever dev blog aka digital garden! 

I've just finished my FullStack Coding Bootcamp that lasted ~7 months and I've learnt so much, so I figured I start a blog to document my continued learning on my way to being a Software Developer

Instead of a blog, think of this as my digital garden documenting where I will [#learninpublic](https://learninpublic.org/v1-principles-learn-in-public.pdf) 📝

I plan to populate my garden with plants on:

- The stack I'm using: JavaScript, Node.js, React, styled-components, GraphQL
- The topics im preparing for interviews: Arrays, Linked Lists and String Manipulations 
- Projects I build
- My journey to becoming a Software Engineer

Note that there is no set planting schedule, and the plants may be re-tended to.

I hope you enjoy visiting my garden 🌻

And I look forward to being invited to yours one day 😛
