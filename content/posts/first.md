Hello world!

I recently graduated from the University of Toronto's FullStack Coding Bootcamp In May, and now I'm working towards getting my first paid opportunity as a Software Engineer / Software Developer

The bootcamp lasted 6 months and I've learnt so much,  I figured I would document my learning during this crucial time between completing my course and getting hired as a developer. 

Instead of thinking of this as a blog, I'd like to think of this as a place where I will [#learninpublic](https://learninpublic.org/v1-principles-learn-in-public.pdf) 📝

I plan to populate my garden with plants on:

- The stack I'm using: JavaScript, React, styled-components, GraphQL, MongoDB and Mongoose
- The topics im preparing for interviews: Arrays, Linked Lists and String Manipulations 
- Projects I build
- My journey to becoming a Software Engineer

Note that there is no set planting schedule, and the plants may be re-tended to.

I hope you enjoy visiting my garden 🌻

And I look forward to being invited to yours one day 😛
